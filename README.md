* 💽 I love working with data that makes my computer's head spin
* ⚠️ Running AI at scale is super addictive
* 🖥️ Distributed computing: because science shows the number of nodes is directly proportional to your happiness!

## Dogmas
* ‼️ Accessibility in tech should be a principle, not a feature
* 📈 Upscaling AI model parameters is low-hanging fruit
* 😍 Multi-modal tokenizers are super sexy
* 🔍 Complexity is not an excuse for the lack of observability and interpretability (unless we’re dealing with the truly *elemental*—where Heisenberg might disagree).
* 🛠️ Pydantic is all you need
